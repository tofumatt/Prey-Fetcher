**Prey Fetcher isn't operating anymore and the code is out-of-date/broken.**

But you can use it if you like.

## Push your tweets to your iPhone ##

Prey Fetcher was a _free and open source service_ that pushed new tweets and direct messages to your iPhone, iPod Touch, or iPad. It requires [Prowl](http://prowl.weks.net), an iPhone Growl client. Prey Fetcher uses Twitter's REST and Streaming APIs to deliver fast list notifications and _instant_ notifications of DMs and mentions.
