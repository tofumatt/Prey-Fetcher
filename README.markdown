# Warning
## Highly Experimental Development Version
This is an attempt at rewriting Prey Fetcher to use Sinatra and DataMapper. The nature of the site is quite small and Sinatra seems a better fit for it. This does not currently work. At all.

## Stable Release
The last stable release prior to this rewrite can be found in the [rails-stable branch](http://github.com/tofumatt/Prey-Fetcher/tree/rails-stable).

This means that you can distribute/use modified and/or unmodified versions however you like, but you have to make the source code available if you modify it and run it on your own server somewhere. I'm fine with multiple Prey Fetcher instances (even if other ones cost money), but the goal is to get any improvements to the code base back to everyone, including me (so I can use them at [preyfetcher.com](http://preyfetcher.com), if I want).
