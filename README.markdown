# Prey Fetcher #
## Depreciated/Unmaintained Rails 2.3 Version

[Prey Fetcher has been rewritten as a more lightweight Sinatra app using DataMapper](http://github.com/tofumatt/Prey-Fetcher). This is the last stable version of Prey Fetcher that was deployed in production before the switch to Sinatra. It is not, to my knowledge, 100% deployable on another server but if you really poke around you can probably find out what needs to be set and do it yourself.

This version is no longer developed/maintained. You can feel free to fork and improve upon this version for your own purposes, but I will probably not incorporate your changes as I'm using neither Rails nor ActiveRecord in the new version. If you want to contribute, [check out the main branch's README](http://github.com/tofumatt/Prey-Fetcher/blob/master/README.markdown).

This means that you can distribute/use modified and/or unmodified versions however you like, but you have to make the source code available if you modify it and run it on your own server somewhere. I'm fine with multiple Prey Fetcher instances (even if other ones cost money), but the goal is to get any improvements to the code base back to everyone, including me (so I can use them at [preyfetcher.com](http://preyfetcher.com), if I want).
