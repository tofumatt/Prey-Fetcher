<h3>Open tweets in your favourite Twitter app</h3>

<p>Use the app name "Prey Fetcher" to redirect all notifications from Prey Fetcher to <a href="http://forums.cocoaforge.com/viewtopic.php?f=45&amp;t=20704">any app Prowl supports</a>. You can also use "Prey Fetcher DM" specifically for DM notifications or "Prey Fetcher mention" for mentions — in case, for example, you only want DMs to open your Twitter app.</p>

<h3>What does Prey Fetcher do?</h3>

<p>Prey Fetcher connects to realtime data provided by <a href="http://twitter.com">Twitter</a> to notify you of new mentions, retweets, and direct messages. Prey Fetcher also lets you know whenever a new tweet appears in a list you create. You can use any of these features in any combination you like, all for free.</p>

<h3>Why Is Prey Fetcher Free?</h3>

<p>Because <a href="http://lonelyvegan.com">Matt</a> really wanted to get notified of new tweets on his iPhone. He figured he might as well make it free for anyone in the same boat.</p>

<p>Prey Fetcher has been around since August 2009 — and it shouldn't be going anywhere as long as tweets still need to make it to people's iPhones.</p>
