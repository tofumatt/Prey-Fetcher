<h3>What does Prey Fetcher do?</h3>

<p>Prey Fetcher connects to realtime data provided by <a href="http://twitter.com">Twitter</a> to notify you of new mentions, retweets, and direct messages. Prey Fetcher also lets you know whenever a new tweet appears in a list you create. You can use any of these features in any combination you like, all for free.</p>

<h3>Why Is Prey Fetcher Free?</h3>

<p>Because <a href="http://lonelyvegan.com">Matt</a> really wanted to get notified of new tweets on his iPhone. He figured he might as well make it free for anyone in the same boat.</p>

<p>Prey Fetcher has been around since August 2009 â€” and it shouldn't be going anywhere as long as tweets still need to make it to people's iPhones.</p>
